<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">International dance aims to nurture and groom students to excel in the area of dance.&nbsp; The International Dance CCA strives to spark passion for dance in our many young talents and for high standards of achievements in all performances and competitions we take part in.&nbsp; Our dance members are exposed to different dance genres and a variety of dance moves and techniques and the CCA hopes to be a cornerstone to develop future talents in Nan Chiau Primary School. We hope that our dancers will learn values that they can internalize throughout their life and boost their appreciation of the aesthetics, especially in the area of dance.</p>
