<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">A Samba band&nbsp;or&nbsp;samba&nbsp;is a&nbsp;musical ensemble&nbsp;that plays&nbsp;samba music. Samba styled music originates from Brazil. A samba band normally consists of&nbsp;Tamborims&nbsp;,&nbsp;Snare drums&nbsp;(Caixa),&nbsp; Agogô bells,&nbsp;Surdos,&nbsp;Ganzás&nbsp;/&nbsp;Chocalho&nbsp;(shakers),&nbsp;Cuíca,&nbsp;Timbal,&nbsp;Pandeiro, and the&nbsp;Repinique&nbsp;(often played by the leader for calls) whistles (at the beginning to give the samba a beat). The&nbsp;Apito&nbsp;is often used by the leader to signal breaks and calls. Genres of music such as reggae, funk, hip hop and Brazilian folk music are played using Samba drums. The music is very loud, which is similar to other drumming bands, so it attracts listeners.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;"></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Our members learn the techniques of playing the different drums in the ensemble. The different drums require different techniques in order to produce Samba music collectively as a band. Teamwork is essential among the players of different drums in producing a musical piece. This is being emphasised greatly during the practices.</p>
