The Environmental club in Nan Chiau Primary School is in its second year of recruitment and establishment. This year, the environmental club combines with the gardening club and students are engaged in both gardening and activities related to the environment. The students designed posters to encourage donation of spectacles as well as the drink tabs. Before Earth hour which falls on 25 March, students make use of CCA timing to promote supporting Earth hour to the various CCA groups. They make posters and learn to speak confidently as well as supporting their fellow club members when they are sharing.<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;"></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">On 1 June, the environmental club members will be attending the 11<sup style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 12px; line-height: 0; position: relative; vertical-align: baseline; top: -0.5em;">th</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>Green camp organised by Hwa Chong institution. The theme of our camp this year is “Reducing Your Carbon Footprint!” Through the activities, we can increase the students’ awareness of the contributors to their carbon footprint and the simple daily decisions they can take to reduce it. We also hope to educate and instill a sense of responsibility among students to protect the environment. This camp aims to teach students the implications of human activities on the environment as well as impart to them good practices that they can adopt to save the environment. We hope that by the end of this 1-day camp, students will be aware of their impact on the environment and play an active role in caring for the environment.</p>
