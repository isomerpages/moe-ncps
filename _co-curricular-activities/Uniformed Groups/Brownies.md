<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Brownies is part of the Guiding Movement (Girl Guides Singapore) and is best described as the primary school version of Girl Guides. It is an educational youth movement, open to all girls from Primary 3 to 6.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;"></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">This CCA aims to provide girls with the opportunity for self-training in the development of character, in the realisation of responsible citizenship and promotion of service to the community. A wide range of indoor and outdoor activities will help balance physical, mental and social development of the girls.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Brownie members will have the opportunity to learn basic life skills and have good knowledge about Singapore. Kindness and helpfulness are key values that will be instilled in every Brownie; this will be achieved by their involvement in fundraising activities and volunteer work. Brownies will also get to learn other necessary skills through field trips, fun activities and appropriate tasks or projects to help them acquire their proficiency badges.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The Brownie Sixers and Seconds will be provided with ample opportunities to hone their leadership skills as they will be tasked to lead several teamwork-focused activities during the year.&nbsp; Brownies will learn to work well as a team to make decisions in their groups and engage in meaningful group discussions.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;"><span style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;">We warmly welcome girls who are adventurous, enthusiastic, enjoy helping others and have interest in singing, craft work and games!</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>
