## Staff Appreciation Day


### [Words of Affirmation](https://form.gov.sg/64528b56b91c1900116f7c34)

We often find our teachers working tirelessly to motivate our students, checking in on their well-being while partnering with our parents to bring out the best in our students. Educators pour so much into everyone around them and everything they do.

Non-teaching staff is also an important team that ensures the smooth running of the school.

Hereâ€™s your chance to affirm both teaching and non-teaching staff of their efforts and hard work. It will only take a few minutes, but the impact of those words will lead to positive environment for everybody because

when our staff feel valued and appreciated at work, it trickles down to all our students.
