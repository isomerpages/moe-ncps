#### **Our Core Student Care Programme**

**Homework Supervision**<br>
At NASCANS, we support students in approaching their homework with focus and responsibility. Our dedicated mentors provide supervision, guiding students to stay on track as they complete their assignments. This helps ease the homework routine for families and allows parents to enjoy more quality time with their child at home.

**Character Education**<br>
At NASCANS, character education is an integral part of our daily programme, aimed at nurturing positive values and personal growth. Our approach fosters an environment where children can build essential life skills that contribute to their overall development and well-being.

**Enrichment**<br>
At NASCANS, enrichment programmes are designed to enhance students' learning experiences beyond the classroom. These programmes provide opportunities for personal growth, creativity, and skill development in a variety of areas. Students are encouraged to explore their interests, develop new talents, and build confidence.

**Outdoor**<br>
At Nascans, outdoor activities play a vital role in fostering physical, social, and emotional development. Through carefully planned outdoor experiences, students are encouraged to explore nature, engage in active play, and develop teamwork and leadership skills. These activities not only promote a healthy lifestyle but also provide opportunities for children to connect with their environment. 
NASCANS is supported by a dedicated team at our headquarters, bringing decades of experience in the effective management and operation of student care centres. Our team's expertise ensures that we consistently provide high-quality care and support for students.
