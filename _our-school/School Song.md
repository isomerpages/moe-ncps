**First Verse**:  
Our passion is burning  
Our songs are soaring  
Let us praise in a single voice  
Beloved Nan Chiau.

Reinvent ourselves  
Thrive in the dynamic era  
Promote the Chinese culture  
Seek glory for our nation

**Chorus**:  
Beloved teachers and friends  
Beloved schoolmates  
Let us put our hearts together  
To work towards our common goal

**Second Verse**  
Passion in learning  
Relentless in pursuing  
Uphold our school motto  
Sincerity and perseverance

Reinvent ourselves  
Thrive in the dynamic era  
Promote the Chinese culture  
Seek glory for our nation

**Chorus**:  
Beloved teachers and friends  
Beloved schoolmates  
Let us put our hearts together  
To work towards our common goal
