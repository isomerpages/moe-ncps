#### Our Crest
The crest is represented by three interlocking rings which symbolise the moral, physical and intellectual development of the pupils. These are intrinsic to the quest for excellence in education.

The red colour of the rings depicts a persevering spirit to pursue a bright and promising future, as represented by the golden background.

The heart shape in the overlapping centre symbolises care and concern for the total welfare of pupils in a pupil-oriented system.
