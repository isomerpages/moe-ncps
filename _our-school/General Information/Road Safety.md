#### Parents' Role
Road safety is a shared responsibility.&nbsp; Parents play an important role in modelling positive road safety behaviour for our children.&nbsp; Parents are reminded to abide by traffic rules and&nbsp; adhere to the schools’ traffic management policies.

#### Driving

**Driving within the school compound**<br>
Drive slowly and keep to the speed limit of 15 km/h when you enter the school compound. To keep the school compound safe, parents are allowed to drive-in to the school only from 4.20 p.m. onwards.

**Driving within school vicinity**<br>
Please adhere to the speed limit of 40 km/h while driving in the school zone area.&nbsp; Stay alert for pedestrians and do not sound the car horn indiscriminately.

**Dropping off your&nbsp;child**<br>
Alight your child at the designated drop-off point at Gate C and not along the main road at Gate A or B. Get your child to be ready to alight when your car approaches the designated drop-off point. Your child should alight swiftly on the side nearest to the kerb.&nbsp; Parents should promptly drive off once your child has alighted from the car.

#### Parking

Parking at the school compound is strictly for authorised personnel only.&nbsp; Parents/guardians who are visiting the school (e.g. meeting with teachers or school leaders) are to park at the nearby multi-storey car parks. For parents who are driving to pick up their child who is unwell/injured, you may park your vehicle for a short duration (not exceeding 10 minutes) at the visitors’ carpark lots.

Do not park or wait along the roads outside the school as this will cause obstruction to traffic flow and inconvenience to nearby residents. If you need to wait, kindly park at the nearby multi-storey carparks.

We seek your understanding and fullest cooperation as our students’ safety and well-being is of utmost concern.
