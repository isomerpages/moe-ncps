### **Global Awareness Programme (GAP)**
#### **心系南侨，放眼世界**

Nan Chiau’s Global Awareness Programme (GAP) emphasizes collective identity and enhances global outlook among our students. Experiential Learning Theory is extensively applied. We strive to provide opportunities for our students to: 

*  stay rooted to their heritage while setting their sights afar;
*  develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. 
*  establish network and build friendship across borders and cultures;
*  deepen students’ rootedness to Singapore

#### **Signature Activities**

**Celebration of Cultural festivals**

Nan Chiau infuses global awareness into the celebration of cultural festivals. Students get to understand each other’s language and culture, participate in cultural festivities and share festive joy with the Sengkang community. 

Teachers promote awareness of the major cultural festivals to students through sharing traditions and customs of cultural festivals at the Cultural exposure@MTrex.

**Overseas Immersion**

Before the COVID pandemic, Nan Chiau organized overseas immersion trips to China X’ian and Suzhou for P5 students annually. During pandemic, we organize virtual overseas immersion to Vietnam for Primary 5 students. Primary 6 students get to explore our Hokkien heritage through virtual immersion to Fujian, China.

Through the overseas immersion, students go on an experiential journey to explore the diverse Language and Culture of the different countries, establish friendship and develop a global outlook.
