#### **Department Vision**

Every child is a&nbsp;_creative problem solver_&nbsp;(innovative, think of different ways), with a&nbsp;_positive attitude_&nbsp;(beliefs, interest, appreciation, confidence, perseverance) towards Mathematics

#### **Department Focus**

*   To equip students with&nbsp;_mathematical knowledge, skills and dispositions_&nbsp;for lifelong learning
*   To empower teachers to provide a more&nbsp;_engaging, student-centred, and technology-enabled_&nbsp;learning environment in Content, Pedagogy and Assessment

#### **Department Approach**

#### **Differentiated Instruction**&nbsp;
**To stretch, enhance, and support**

To better support students who need more reinforcement in their learning of Mathematics, the department has Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) programmes for selected Primary One and Primary Two students. Students are put into smaller groups so that the teacher can customize activities based on their learning progress.

For students with high ability in Mathematics, they will be invited to join the Excellence 2000 (E2K) for Mathematics programme.

The competitions which we participate in:

*   Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC) – P4 to P6
*   National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore by NUS High (NMOS) – P4 and P5
*   Singapore Mathematical Oylmpiad for Primary School by Hwa Chong (SMOPS) – P6 &amp; selected P5 students

#### **Key Programmes**

**1.&nbsp;‘I am a young Mathematics star’**<img src="/images/Our%20Curriculum%20Math/star%20resized.png" style="width:30%">



To build our students’ interests and confidence in Mathematics, the department designed simple and fun activities to engage them to connect Mathematics with their daily life experiences, and experience successes in Mathematics.

**2\. RC3&nbsp;(Reasoning, Communication, Collaboration and Connection)**

<img src="/images/Our%20Curriculum%20Math/Math-RC.png" style="width:30%">

Traditional teacher-centric lessons are no longer effective to meet the learning needs of our 21st century students. To prepare our students for future challenges, RC3&nbsp;is a project which the department customized for our P3 and P4 students. Comprehensive lesson packages using the&nbsp;inquiry-based approach&nbsp;are carefully-designed for selected topics, to develop confident communicators with good reasoning skills. With the use of technology, student-centric activities with&nbsp;authentic learning experiences&nbsp;are implemented to make learning relevant, engaging and meaningful to their lives. This is to create opportunities for the students to discover, reason and communicate mathematics, through stimulating discussions and activities where they can explore possibilities and make connections, through collaborations with their peers.

**3.&nbsp;Play@Recess**&nbsp;
<img src="/images/Our%20Curriculum%20Math/Math-Model-1.png" style="width:60%">
Our students learn the best through play. Through these Mathematics games, students are able to better grasp their concepts, have a deeper understanding and apply the concepts learnt in class.

**4**.&nbsp;**BEST Mathematical Problem Solving Approach**

Problem Solving is at the heart of the Singapore Mathematics Curriculum. Our school adopts the BEST Mathematical Problem Solving Approach to develop our students’ metacognition. B for Be focused. E for explore and plan. S for solve the problem and T for think about the answer. This comprises of a list of questions to help students monitor and direct their cognitive resources to better understand and make sense of a given problem. Through the monitoring of their own thinking, students also increase ownership and take charge of their own learning.

**5.**&nbsp;**CONCRETE – pictorial – abstract**

We strongly believes that students have a deeper understanding of the concepts learnt through hands-on activities. Through these activities using Math manipulative, students are able to better grasp their concepts and apply the concepts in the assigned tasks.
