The English Department is a diverse group of life-long learners who constantly challenge and encourage our students to learn actively, communicate effectively and think critically so that they contribute their acquired skills to the community.

#### **Department Mission**  

To instil the love of English Language Learning and Reading through different strategies and foster life-long learning by Integrating 21 CC and values into the curriculum.

#### **Department Approach**  
   
At NCPS, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading, writing, speaking, listening, viewing &amp; representing skills for effective communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience through explicit instruction and communicative approach to language development anchored on the English Language Syllabus 2020 (MOE, Singapore).

#### **Core Curriculum**  

STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) is the core
curriculum which the school adopts for English Language. STELLAR aims to
strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a
positive attitude towards learning in the foundation years. The programme

**School-based Reading Programme**

The objective of our Reading Programme is to develop students’ interest and positive attitude to
learning beyond their comfort zones, indirectly improving their achievement in the language, and
fostering in them a life-long habit of self-directed learning for information and enjoyment. By
providing students with a repertoire of resources that are current and of interest, we believe that
their motivation in learning beyond the classroom will grow. Students will be intrinsically motivated
to find out more, share their knowledge, and build on one another’s knowledge.

technology for learning and can:

**Experiential Learning**  
   
* Teaching English with hands-on activities can help language students learn and practice new vocabulary, grammar, ideas, and concepts.
* Students learn in a variety of ways, so it is important to teach using multiple methods.&nbsp;By incorporating hands-on experiences in our English lessons, students have higher levels of engagement and learning.

**Learning English Through Fun &amp; Games** 

* Games are a fun way to practise English – it can be a really motivating way to learn a language.
* Games are also great for students who are shy or worried about making mistakes. It can give them an opportunity to communicate in English in a safe and fun way.
* Games encourage teamwork, problem-solving and creativity – and everyone wins! Students can play together in a fun, supportive way and improve their English at the same time.
