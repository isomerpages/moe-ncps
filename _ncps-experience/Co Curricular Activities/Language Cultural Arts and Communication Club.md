<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The Language Cultural Arts and Communication Club allows students to explore diverse languages and cultural arts, promoting creativity and effective communication through journalism, drama, and communication skills. A key focus is Broadcast Journalism, where students learn reporting, recording, and basic editing. They applied these skills by covering events like the Chinese New Year Celebration and School Anniversary Celebration. These experiences help students develop holistically and enhance communication skills and teamwork as they collaborate to achieve their goals.  </p>
