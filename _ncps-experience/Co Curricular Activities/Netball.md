<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The Netball Club is newly set up in January 2016. Weekly training are conducted every Thursdays from 2.00-4.00 pm.&nbsp;During each training, the girls are taught dynamic stretches which will help them to warm up the targeted major muscle groups. The girls will then perform some ball handling drills to increase their familiarisation with the ball. Refinement tasks are also carried out on the girls to hone their attacking skills such as shooting, using off-the-ball movements to move away from defender, receiving the ball effectively from the thrower etc. Rules of the game are introduced as the girls play the netball game. These real life experiences will definitely help them to remember the rules better.

Netball is a team sport where our dedicated girls learn a plethora of values from teamwork to perseverance. It is a sport which will help the girls to discover their leadership potential and how to be a good team player. Perseverance and determination are inculcated as they will have to learn how to accept defeat as well as victory through the planned netball matches.

Last but not least, building camaraderie and confidence are the most valuable takeaways from playing in this sport.</p>
