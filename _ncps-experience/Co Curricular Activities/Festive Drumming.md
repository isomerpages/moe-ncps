<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Festive drumming is a synchronised loud drums performance. The performance is typically associated with celebrations and prosperity and involves large groups of performers following a choreographed routine and working in unison to entertain or inspire their audiences. Drums and sticks are ornately decorated with colors and imagery fitting the occasion. Performers also wear beautifully-designed costumes in matching shades.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;"></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">During the sessions, students master not only the drumming skills, but also unique body movements and positions. Festive drumming also emphasises a lot on perseverance, character building, cooperation, and teamwork.</p>
