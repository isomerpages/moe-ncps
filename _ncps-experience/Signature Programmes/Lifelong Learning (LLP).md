The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is one of the teaching tools to guide and support student leadership for both staff and students in school. For P1 to P5 levels, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is taught during Watch Me Soar (WMS) lessons. The 7 Habits cohort trainings are conducted for Upper Primary levels to reinforce their learning and application as they prepare for their secondary school journey. Prefect leadership trainings are also anchored on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as it builds character and competence to develop student leadership towards self-directed learning.
