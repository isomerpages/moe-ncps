#### <b>Bi-cultural Chinese Elective Programme (BiCEP) </b>
#### <b>双文化华文优选课程</b>

BiCEP is a SHHK signature programme to develop a core group of effectively bilingual students. Launched in 2017, the BiCEP curriculum is designed by a team of experienced Chinese Language teachers, in consultation with professionals in the Chinese Language and Culture. 
Eligible students are invited to join the 3-year programme at the end of Primary three. The 3-year curriculum allows students to explore Chinese Literature and Culture, learn Translation and Oratorical skills, in the process discover their passion and interest in Chinese language and culture.
