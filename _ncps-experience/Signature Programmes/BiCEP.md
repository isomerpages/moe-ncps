#### Bi-cultural Chinese Elective Programme (BiCEP) 
#### 双文化华文优选课程

BiCEP is a SHHK signature programme to develop a core group of effectively bilingual students. Launched in 2017, the BiCEP curriculum is designed by a team of experienced Chinese Language teachers, in consultation with professionals in the Chinese Language and Culture. 
Eligible students are invited to join the 3-year programme at the end of Primary three. The 3-year curriculum allows students to explore Chinese Literature and Culture, learn Translation and Oratorical skills, in the process discover their passion and interest in Chinese language and culture.

#### BiCEP SIGNATURE ACTIVITIES
##### 1. BICEP Language and Cultural Camp
Primary four BiCEP students receive training in oratorical skills as part of BiCEP curriculum, before joining their BiCEP peers from the other 4 SHHK affiliated primary schools at the BICEP Language and Cultural Camp.
##### 2. Nan Chiau Ambassador Programme
To promote student leadership and hone their bilingual communication skills, BiCEP students are trained as Nan Chiau (NC) Ambassadors. NC Ambassadors are Nan Chiau’s heritage champions. They lead school tours, reminiscing about the NC Story with students and visitors to the school.
##### 3. Overseas Immersion Programme
Primary five BiCEP students joined their BiCEP peers in overseas immersion trips to Beijing, Xi‘an and Taipei. The experiential journey provides a real-life connection with the BiCEP curriculum. Students get to explore their Chinese heritage, establish friendship with foreign students and broaden their horizons.
