<p>Nan Chiau Enriched Curriculum (NCEC) aims to nurture NCPS students into <strong>stewards of a better tomorrow</strong> who
can navigate the future with confidence, make a positive impact <strong>on</strong> the
community <strong>and</strong> environment, and stay rooted in NC values
and heritage. The NCEC content is premised on the idea of developing <strong>a sense of agency</strong> in
our students, with a focus on cultivating <strong>an enterprising mindset</strong>â€”one
that our pioneers demonstrated as they navigated challenges while migrating
to and settling in Singapore in the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
