Nan Chiau Enriched Curriculum (NCEC) aims to nurture NCPS students into **stewards of a better tomorrow** who can navigate the future with confidence, make a positive impact to the community or environment while staying rooted in NC values and heritage. The NCEC content is premised on the idea of developing **a sense of agency** in our students with a focus on cultivating among them **an enterprising mindset** that our pioneers had, as they navigate challenges from migrating to and settling in Singapore in the 19th and early 20th century.
