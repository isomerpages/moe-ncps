<h4>Inspiring Confident Thinkers, Compassionate Leaders</h4>
<p>At Nan Chiau Primary School, we believe in nurturing every child through
a rich and holistic educational experience.Our Nan Chiau Enriched Curriculum
(NCEC) goes beyond the academic core to develop students’ character, creativity
and competencies for the future.</p>
<p>Through NCEC, every Nan Chiau student grows as a confident communicator,
thoughtful innovator, and caring leader — ready to contribute meaningfully
to Singapore and the world.</p>
<p>It is anchored in three key programmes:</p>
<p>________________________________________</p>
<p>1) Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Design Thinking &amp; Innovation</p>
<p>Our ALP develops future-ready learners who are critical, inventive and
adaptive. Through engaging STEM projects and real-world challenges, our
students apply the Design Thinking process to solve problems, create prototypes
and innovate for a better future.</p>
<p>• Tier 1: Primary 3 to 5 students experience integrated STEM learning</p>
<p>• Tier 2: Selected P5 students participate in Watch Me Soar (WMS) Banded
Programmes like Innovation Programme (IvP) and SHHK Thinkers Programme</p>

Sports and Outdoor Education</p>
<p>The LLP fosters resilience, teamwork and responsible leadership through
sports and outdoor learning. Students build confidence and character through
values-in-action activities and leadership roles that inspire them to care
for peers and the community.</p>

heritage, and global perspectives.</p>
