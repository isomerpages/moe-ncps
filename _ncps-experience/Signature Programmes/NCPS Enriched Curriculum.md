#### Inspiring Confident Thinkers, Compassionate Leaders
At Nan Chiau Primary School, we believe in nurturing every child through a rich and holistic educational experience. Our Nan Chiau Enriched Curriculum (NCEC) goes beyond the academic core to develop students’ character, creativity and competencies for the future.<br>
Through NCEC, every Nan Chiau student grows as a confident communicator, thoughtful innovator, and caring leader — ready to contribute meaningfully to Singapore and the world.<br>
It is anchored in three key programmes:

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Design Thinking &amp; Innovation**<br>
Our ALP develops future-ready learners who are critical, inventive and adaptive. Through engaging STEM projects and real-world challenges, our students apply the Design Thinking process to solve problems, create prototypes and innovate for a better future.<br>
* Tier 1: Primary 3 to 5 students experience integrated STEM learning
* Tier 2: Selected P5 students participate in Watch Me Soar (WMS) Banded Programmes like Innovation Programme (IvP) and SHHK Thinkers Programme

**Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Character &amp; Leadership through Sports and Outdoor Education**<br>
The LLP fosters resilience, teamwork and responsible leadership through sports and outdoor learning. Students build confidence and character through values-in-action activities and leadership roles that inspire them to care for peers and the community.
* Emphasis on compassionate leadership, sportsmanship and school pride
* Opportunities for all students to grow as peer leaders and active citizens

**BiCEP/GAP: Bilingualism and Global Awareness**<br>
The Bilingual &amp; Bicultural Chinese Enrichment Programme (BiCEP) and Global Awareness Programme (GAP) enhance students’ appreciation of culture, heritage, and global perspectives.
* BiCEP deepens love for the Chinese Language and culture through storytelling, literature, and cross-cultural experiences
* GAP exposes students to international issues and diverse cultures, fostering global-mindedness and respect
