#### Empowering Young Minds Through Design Thinking and Innovation
At Nan Chiau Primary School, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) nurtures future-ready learners who think critically, inventively, and adaptively. Anchored in the vision of a **Smart Nation** and aligned with **MOE’s 21st Century Competencies**, our ALP empowers students with real-world problem-solving skills using **STEM and Design Thinking**.<br>
#### Future-Ready Learners in the Making
Our ALP builds confidence and creativity in every student. Whether through broad exposure in Tier 1 or deeper dives in Tier 2, students are empowered to be thoughtful problem solvers, innovative thinkers, and contributors to a better tomorrow.

##### Tier 1: STEM for All
Our Tier 1 programme offers from Primary 3 to 5 students a hands-on experience in STEM through age-appropriate design thinking challenges. Every student can participate in:
* Designing smart furniture
* Creating healthy lifestyle tools
* Building simple prototypes with purpose
* Applying computational thinking in everyday life

##### Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Programme
In our school, the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Programme uses the TEMI service robot to give students an authentic and engaging platform to apply STEM learning in real-world contexts. Through hands-on activities, students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, programming, creativity, and teamwork skills while exploring how AI and automation can improve daily life in school. TEMI also supports Design Thinking, enabling students to identify user needs and design purposeful solutions. With opportunities for senior students to mentor their juniors, the programme nurtures leadership, digital confidence, and collaboration. Ultimately, it prepares our learners to thrive in a future shaped by smart technologies and innovation.
