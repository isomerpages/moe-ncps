<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)&nbsp;is an integral part of our students’
holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and
talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them
for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students
from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation
in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging,
commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation. <em>(Quoted from MOE website)</em>
</p>
<p>At Nan Chiau Primary School, all P3 to P6 students are strongly encouraged
to participate in&nbsp;<strong>one CCA</strong>. Our school offers a wide
range of 20 CCAs in the domains of Aesthetics/Performing Arts, Sports,
Uniformed Group and Clubs &amp; Societies. CCAs are conducted on Thursdays
and Fridays, from 2 to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>We are committed to make CCA a meaningful experience for every student.
In turn, we expect all students to take pride in their CCA and take responsibility
for their learning in the CCA.</p>
