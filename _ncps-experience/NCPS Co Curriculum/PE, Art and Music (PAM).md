<p>The overall aim of the PE, Music and Art education is to promote Physical
Education, Music &amp; Art in 3 aspects: KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS and VALUES</p>
<p>At the end of their 6 years primary school education in NCPS, every student
will be:</p>
<p>• equipped with the necessary skills, attitude and knowledge to maintain
and sustain healthy lifestyle through the Eat Right and Live Healthily
Programme;
<br>• aesthetically cultured through enjoyable and purposeful experiences
of different visual and performing arts and music programmes;
<br>• instilled with life-long interest in and an appreciation for Art and
Music.</p>
<h4><strong>Talent development in PAM</strong></h4>
<p>Students are given opportunities to apply the skills and knowledge they
learnt during their PE lessons and recreational sports CCA to participate
in intra and inter class competitions. Talented students who are spotted
will be recommended to join the school team.</p>
<p>Students are also given the chance to excel in the aesthetics. &nbsp;Through
the art and music lessons, talented students who are spotted to have an
interest or &nbsp;good in music and art are given various platforms such
as school concerts, mass singing, internal art competitions, etc., to display
their talents. Outstanding students who displayed exceptionally capabilities
in music and art are then sent for external competitions.</p>
<h4><strong>PLAY @ Recess</strong></h4>
<p>Students are also encouraged to keep fit by engaging in sports and games
during their recess. Activities related to art and music have also be included
to cater to students who enjoy these activities. Karaoke sessions and art
and craft activities have been introduced to add vibrancy during recess.</p>
<p>These activities are often in line with the NE related theme and festivities.</p>

<h4><strong>Harnessing of Technology</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Physical Education</strong>
<br>Technology is part and parcel of life at Nan Chiau Primary School. To
leverage on the power of technology, the PE department have started to
use Polar Heart Rate Monitors which are specifically developed for the
young. This technology allows students to record the duration of exercise
as well as the level of intensity during a PE lesson. The data is then
used by the students to plan for their own exercise programme which will
have the maximum positive impact on their health and fitness.&nbsp; As
a result, students thus become more self-directed and independent.</p>
<p><strong>Art</strong> 
<br>The Art Blog will be further enhanced to include more features. Virtual
Art Museum tours and more digitalised students’ art work will be included
in the Art Blog. Students are able to explore YouTube links which are shared
on the Art Blog to extend their lessons and learn.</p>
<p>Learning journey to the National Art Gallery will be conducted for students
where they will make use of their tablets to take photographs and post
up on blogs via the LMS portal.</p>
<p>Primary 3 – 4 utilize tablets in their digital art photography lessons
as part of their art curriculum. Students are also encouraged to search
for online sources and research via their tablet for inspiration.</p>
<p>Eco-Bin competition- Research and voting are done online.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong> 
<br>IT related music programme was adopted to make&nbsp;music lessons&nbsp;more
enjoyable and student centric.</p>
<p>A new keyboard room has been set-up where ICT devices such as IPads can
be connected and utilized for music lessons.</p>
<p>The music department leverages on ICT tools which are available to supplement
their curriculum. Garage band is introduced into the curriculum where students
are exposed to the use of IPads to play tunes via music apps.</p>
