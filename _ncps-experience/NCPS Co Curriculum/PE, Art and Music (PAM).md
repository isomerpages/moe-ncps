Physical Education, Art and Music curriculum plays an important role in
the holistic development of students in Nan Chiau Primary School.
The overall aim of the PE, Music and Art education is to promote Physical
	Education, Music &amp; Art in 3 aspects: <b>KNOWLEDGE</b>, <b>SKILLS</b> and <b>VALUES</b>
	
At the end of their 6 years primary school education in NCPS, every student
will be:
* equipped with the necessary skills, attitude and knowledge to maintain
and sustain healthy lifestyle through the Eat Right and Live Healthily
Programme;
* aesthetically cultured through enjoyable and purposeful experiences
of different visual and performing arts and music programmes;
* instilled with life-long interest in and an appreciation for Art and
Music.

#### Talent development in PAM
Students are given opportunities to apply the skills and knowledge they
learnt during their PE lessons and recreational sports CCA to participate
in intra and inter class competitions. Talented students who are spotted
will be recommended to join the school team.
Students are also given the chance to excel in the aesthetics. &nbsp;Through
the art and music lessons, talented students who are spotted to have an
interest or &nbsp;good in music and art are given various platforms such
as school concerts, mass singing, internal art competitions, etc., to display
their talents. Outstanding students who displayed exceptionally capabilities
in music and art are then sent for external competitions.

#### PLAY @ Recess
Students are also encouraged to keep fit by engaging in sports and games during their recess. Activities related to art and music have also been included to cater to students who enjoy these activities. Designated play areas such as the playground, school field and parade square have been reserved for our students to play in. Our PE Captains are trained and empowered to loan out PE equipment for unstructured play during recess. Our Parent Support Group (PSG) volunteers help to supervise the sessions to look out for the safety of our students.

#### Harnessing of Technology
##### Physical Education

At Nan Chiau Primary School, technology is seamlessly integrated into various aspects of school life, including Physical Education (PE). Recognizing the potential of educational technology (EdTech) to enrich learning experiences, the PE Department has strategically adopted innovative digital tools to enhance the delivery and impact of PE lessons-particularly in areas such as gymnastics and outdoor education.

Through the use of tablets and video analysis applications, students are empowered to take an active role in their learning journey. In gymnastics lessons, for instance, students are able to record their performances, review their movement patterns, and reflect on their execution. This visual feedback allows them to identify areas of improvement and refine their techniques over time.

Additionally, peer feedback is encouraged through structured activities where students use these EdTech tools to review each other's performances and provide constructive suggestions. This not only strengthens their understanding of movement concepts but also builds communication and collaboration skills.

In outdoor education, technology supports experiential learning by enabling students to document their experiences through digital journals, photos, and videos. These records serve as reflective tools that help students internalize key takeaways from their adventures and promote deeper connections with the outdoors.

Overall, the purposeful integration of technology in PE at Nan Chiau Primary School aims to cultivate self-directed learners who are engaged, reflective, and confident in applying movement skills across different contexts.



##### Art
In the refreshed Art syllabus, we actively harness the power of technology to create engaging and meaningful learning experiences across all levels. Students are introduced to digital tools that enhance their creativity and critical thinking. For our lower primary students, interactive platforms like Nearpod are used to enrich classroom lessons, making learning more interactive and accessible. Our Primary 3 students explore storytelling through Stop Motion Animation by learning to plan, design, and animate their own short films. In Primary 4, students delve into the basics of image editing, developing visual literacy and digital design skills. Primary 6 students gain an eye for detail and composition through a photography programme that encourages them to express ideas through the lens. These programmes reflect our commitment to equipping students with the digital skills needed to thrive in the 21st century.


##### Music

**Nan Chiau Primary School Music Committee**

At Nan Chiau Primary School, our Music Committee is committed to nurturing a vibrant and holistic music education that grows with our pupils. Guided by a spiral curriculum design, our music programme is thoughtfully structured to build upon pupils' musical understanding and skills progressively from Primary 1 through Primary 6.

In **Primary 1 and 2**, pupils embark on their musical journey through **Music and Movement** activities. These foundational years focus on developing a strong sense of rhythm, pitch, and beat through singing, body percussion, creative movement, and listening activities. Pupils gain confidence in expressing themselves musically and physically, setting the stage for instrumental learning in later years.

In **Primary 3 and 4**, pupils explore **instrumental proficiency**, with focused instruction on the **ukulele and recorder**. These instruments are carefully selected to deepen pupilsâ€™ understanding of musical elements such as melody, rhythm, and harmony. Through ensemble practice, pupils learn to play in sync with others, listen attentively, and build essential performance skills.

By **Primary 5 and 6**, pupils are ready to participate in **ensemble playing**, a culmination of their prior learning. Using their foundational skills in rhythm, melody, and instrumental techniques, pupils come together to perform in small and large group ensembles. They take on different instrumental parts, collaborate on arrangements, and even explore **songwriting**. Integrated into this phase is the use of ICT tools such as **Song Maker and Chrome Music Lab**, enabling pupils to compose, arrange, and reflect creatively on their musical ideas.

Our programme also aims to identify and develop musical talents. Through performance opportunities and regular assessments, the Music Committee seeks to talent scout pupils with strong musical abilities, especially in instrumental playing and ensemble leadership. These pupils are nurtured further and may represent the school in performances and external events, contributing to the school's vibrant musical culture.

Through this spiraled and student-centred approach, the Nan Chiau Primary Music Committee endeavours to instill a lasting appreciation for music while empowering pupils with the skills, creativity, and confidence to express themselves musically.
