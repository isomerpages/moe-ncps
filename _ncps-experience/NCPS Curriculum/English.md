To instil the love of English Language Learning and Reading through different strategies and foster life-long learning by Integrating 21 CC and values into the curriculum.

#### **Department Approach**  
   
At NCPS, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading, writing, speaking, listening, viewing &amp; representing skills for effective communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience through explicit instruction and communicative approach to language development anchored on the English Language Syllabus 2020 (MOE, Singapore).

**TREX- Time for Reading EXposure**<br>
TREX: In line with Stellar 2.0, we aim to strengthen our children’s language and reading skills through TREX - Time for Reading EXposure. We adopt a school-wide approach where students are exposed to books of different genres in their foundational years. Through this programme, we wish to foster good reading habits in our students and inject a little fun before lessons begin.

**School-based Reading Programme**<br>
The objective of our Reading Programme is to develop students’ interest and positive attitude to
learning beyond their comfort zones, indirectly improving their achievement in the language, and
fostering in them a life-long habit of self-directed learning for information and enjoyment. By
providing students with a repertoire of resources that are current and of interest, we believe that
their motivation in learning beyond the classroom will grow. Students will be intrinsically motivated
to find out more, share their knowledge, and build on one another’s knowledge.
