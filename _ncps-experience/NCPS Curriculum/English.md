strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a
positive attitude towards learning in the foundation years. The programme

**School-based Reading Programme**

The objective of our Reading Programme is to develop students’ interest and positive attitude to
learning beyond their comfort zones, indirectly improving their achievement in the language, and
fostering in them a life-long habit of self-directed learning for information and enjoyment. By
providing students with a repertoire of resources that are current and of interest, we believe that
their motivation in learning beyond the classroom will grow. Students will be intrinsically motivated
to find out more, share their knowledge, and build on one another’s knowledge.

**What is learning support?**
   
Through specialised early intervention programmes, students are provided with structured curriculum to close their learning gaps with their peers.

In addition , NCPS students are digital learners who leverage
technology for learning and can:
* find, think, apply and digitally create.

**Experiential Learning**  
   
* Teaching English with hands-on activities can help language students learn and practice new vocabulary, grammar, ideas, and concepts.
* Students learn in a variety of ways, so it is important to teach using multiple methods.&nbsp;By incorporating hands-on experiences in our English lessons, students have higher levels of engagement and learning.

**Learning English Through Fun &amp; Games** 

* Games are a fun way to practise English – it can be a really motivating way to learn a language.
* Games are also great for students who are shy or worried about making mistakes. It can give them an opportunity to communicate in English in a safe and fun way.
* Games encourage teamwork, problem-solving and creativity – and everyone wins! Students can play together in a fun, supportive way and improve their English at the same time.
