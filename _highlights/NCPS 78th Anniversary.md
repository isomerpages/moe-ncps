#### Nan Chiau Loves Me ("南侨爱我")

![](/images/Highlights/IMG_4039.jpg)

This year's celebration brigns together four generations of the school community to celebrate our Nan Chiau story.

The highlights are the combined dance performance by the current and ex-students from the NCAA weekend dance class, and the rendition of the 《我们这一班》by a group of SG60 ex-students.

The celebration concludes on a high note as four generations of Nan Chiau students gather to reminisce about the old and new memories in a new relaxed setting.
