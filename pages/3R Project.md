### Green Guardians : Every Action Counts! – 3R project

#### Our Mission
Our Environmental Club promotes the 3Rs — Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle — to build sustainable habits within our school and community.

#### The 3Rs Explained
**Reduce:** Cut down on resource use by saving electricity, conserving water, and reducing paper consumption through double-sided printing.

**Reuse:** Use items repeatedly by repurposing containers or upcycling old clothes into useful objects.

**Recycle:** Process used materials like paper, plastic, and metal into new products to reduce waste and conserve natural resources.

#### Community Outreach

**Senior Engagement (12 July):** Students partnered with Lions Befrienders, visiting Block 47 Owen Road to share 3Rs tips with residents whilst delivering food items as part of our Values-In-Action programme.
