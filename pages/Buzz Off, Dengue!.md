#### Our Mission

In response to rising dengue cases in Singapore, our Environmental Club launched the "Buzz Off, Dengue!" project to promote proactive mosquito prevention practices in our school and community.

#### Our Action

**Research & Learning:** Students researched dengue transmission, breeding habitats, and prevention methods using National Environment Agency (NEA) resources and educational materials.

**Community Outreach:** Our students partnered with Lions Befrienders on 17 May, visiting Block 47 Owen Road to share dengue prevention tips with seniors whilst delivering food items as part of their Values-In-Action programme. 

**Creative Engagement**: Students performed an entertaining educational skit using the BLOCK and SAW method, with one member creatively portraying a mosquito to deliver memorable prevention messages to the school community.
