On 8 March 2022, we invited our parents, alumnus and distinguished guests for “Nan Chiau, Our Story Our Pride” NC75 Anniversary webinar e-concert. The main highlight of the e-concert is a puppetry play originated from Fujian Zhangzhou. The puppetry play is a school production, featuring a star-studded cast of our very own teachers (Mr Chuan, Madam Gan & Ms Yvonne Loh) & a 10 Primary five students. The puppetry play was directed by local puppetry artiste, Ms Tan Beng Tian. The storyline centred around our founder, Mr Tan Kah Kee and provides a snapshot of the 75 years of rich heritage of Nan Chiau. The webinar also witnessed a celebration of generations of NC alumni coming forward to showcase their talents and share their fond memories of Nan Chiau.

The celebration continues throughout the month with videos and artworks featuring our students, teachers and Alumni reminiscing their happy moments and sharing their best wishes to the school.

Happy 75th Anniversary to Nan Chiau & Stay tuned to more exciting celebrative activities line up the whole year!
