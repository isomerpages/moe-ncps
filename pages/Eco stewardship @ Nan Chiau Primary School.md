<p>This year, Environmental Club members took part in Project E.C.O. organised
by Clean and Green Singapore and undertook two key projects to promote
sustainability within the school and the community. During Earth Week,
the members engaged fellow schoolmates with interactive booths, games,
and quizzes to raise awareness about food sustainability and waste reduction.
Students who finished their meals during recess were awarded stamps to
redeem NEA-sponsored files, and they also participated in composting activities,
bringing home compost-based fertiliser for their plants.</p>
<p>For public outreach, the members shared practical tips on reducing food
waste with patrons at Kopitiam Square, while also encouraging proper return
of utensils, effectively addressing both sustainability and cleanliness
in one initiative.</p>
<p>At the same time, students encouraged patrons at Kopitiam Square to help
keep the food centre clean by returning their utensils and trays to the
designated stations. We hope these projects will inspire both the school
community and the public to take responsibility for the environment and
show greater consideration for others.</p>
