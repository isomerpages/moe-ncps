The objective of the Cub Scouts program is to provide a group environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically vital and directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need to face and overcome challenges.

Cub Scouts activities are short and wrapped up in the spirit of service to all. Games of every sort are played to ensure a balanced training approach that would teach them to be self-reliant.

The teachers use general Pack games, inter-Six games, sense-training games, relays and some physical endurance training to build stamina and perseverance as a group.

Stories, in particular Kipling’s Jungle Book and other similar stories that involve adventure, romance, humour, history, religious stories etc., are used and help each Cub Scout to more easily understand the meaning of their Promise and Law through analogy, stories and plays. Scouts also sing songs to bring the warmth of certain activities like knot tying, more excitement and engagement.

Play acting such as charades are used as this allows the children to use their imagination freely. Handcrafts are another important activity for a Cub Scout that aims to help children use their fingers and their heads to satisfy their creative instinct and to encourage hobbies in their spare time and at home. Knot tying trains their dexterity and memory skills as they work at remembering the different kinds of knots and their uses.

Foot-drills instil discipline and team work as the pack works together to achieve the desired outcomes.

In short, self-developmental activities are a well-entrenched component of the overall drive towards encouraging “Fun &amp; Discovery” amongst the Cubs.
