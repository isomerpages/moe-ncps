<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The Sports Club exposes students to a variety of sports where they learn different techniques and strategies. It consists of members from all walks of life coming together to integrate, to enhance their proficiency and pursue their passion in sports. Students will work with different members in the CCA which promote teamwork and inculcate values of perseverance and determination in order to leverage on their strengths. Additionally, students are able to discover their passion for different sports and pursue them further after they have learnt the fundamentals in the CCA.  </p>
