<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The Table Tennis CCA is introduced in our school to encourage high participation among our Primary Three students and to pave the pathway to spot promising talents.</p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;"></p><p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using a small racquet. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The interesting thing is most of members have never played table tennis before! They do not know how to hold a racquet correctly, how to serve a ball and play it over. However, all members display their enthusiasm in this game.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Our training session is conducted by experienced and dedicated coaches who focus on developing studentâ€™s skills and knowledge. The players are taught hand-eye coordination, quick reactions, balance and concentration. They also learn the technical and tactical aspects of this racquet-based sport and practise their skills learnt in doubles and singles games during the training sessions. It is our goal that the promising ones will be able to participate in inter-school competitions in subsequent years.</p>

<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-size: 1em;">We aim to equip our players not only with knowledge and skills but also to cultivate in them, perseverance, responsibility and integrity. With the expertise acquired through the coming years, we hope to develop a new generation of young players, who will go on to challenge the best in the world.</p>
