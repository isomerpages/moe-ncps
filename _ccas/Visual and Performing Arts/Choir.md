Our Choir family presently has about 65 members. In each session, they come together to practise their singing abilities as well as strengthen their vocal techniques. They are building a repertoire of songs not only in English or local languages but also in different languages. They not only focus on vocal training but also equipping their competencies in music theory and music approaches like Kodaly.

Following that, the team will be exploring new opportunities in representing the school and performing at different platforms like Singapore International Choral Festival. Similarly for every event, the choir is working very hard as a team and has committed themselves to attending additional practices and rehearsals in order to represent the school well in the eyes of the public.

They always look forward to perform and showcase their abilities. With perseverance, their hard work has definitely shone through their growing skills and talent.
