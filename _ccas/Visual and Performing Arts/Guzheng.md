The Guzheng members are meticulously taught on the various techniques of playing the instrument by a professionally trained Guzheng instructor. They will be given the opportunities to participate in school-based and public performances during different festival celebrations and school events. They also participate in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival which serves as a good platform for them to strengthen and hone their skills. To further widen their exposure to music, Guzheng members also get to attend musical concerts and performances.

The Guzheng members learn how to master fingering skills, intonation, rhythm and tone of the instrument. In addition, they also learn about musicianship in which they try to interpret and express music in their own style and dynamics. Each year, they will be able to learn up to 4-5 musical pieces. Through learning of Guzheng, members will also learn more about the Chinese culture and appreciate the beauty of it.

The Guzheng members also learn to cooperate and help one another during their weekly practices. In order to put up the best performance, they also learn to work together as a team and complement each other strengths. With encouragement from the ensemble, members become more confident and resilient from each performance, constantly striving to improve themselves. &nbsp;Leadership positions will also be rotated to empower the members and inculcate values such as responsibility and unity in them. Lastly, learning Guzheng also helps to foster perseverance and patience in every member, cultivating them into passionate and enthusiastic music learners.
