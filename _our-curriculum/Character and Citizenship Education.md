### **DEPARTMENT FOCUS**

At NCPS, values education forms an integral part of our students’ learning journey. The attached framework guides and provides key directions for the department in the planning, implementation and review of the various activities.

### **NCPS CCE Framework**

style="width:65%">

The school’s CCE framework is based on the school’s 3 key beliefs, Every child can learn, Every child is good and Every child is unique as well as the 4 core school values of Respect, Responsibility, Sincerity and Perseverance. This provides the key direction towards the development of CCE in our students. In school, we teach knowledge through CCE lessons, cyber wellness, FTGP, SEL and Sexuality Education. Through these platforms, students acquire the necessary knowledge (Head) on making morally upright and responsible decisions.

Next to make values learning authentic and relevant, the school leverages on ECG, VIA, CCA, PAL and school events for example the 4 major NE events, charity food donations and distribution of oranges to the neighboring residents. This enables the students to apply the knowledge that they have acquired in class and provides relevance, realism and real life experiences which are difficult to replicate in the classrooms.

As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. The school supports home school partnership towards the development of the child as well as the school’s Family Matters Centre which provides parenting workshops in order to foster closer parent and child relationships.

At the same time, values are taught through the academic subjects and the co-curricular to make learning more relevant to the students’ daily lives. A key platform where the students are also taught the desired values are the school’s 3 Golden Rules (We respect ourselves, we respect one another and we respect this place) which encompasses the school’s efforts in educating the students. These 3 rules are easy for the students to remember and constant references to them are made by the staff on relevant occasions.

Through this process, the school hopes that the students will acquire the necessary knowledge (head), skills (hand) and attitudes (heart) which will enable them to progress towards the 21st CC student learning outcomes. These multiple avenues encourage the students to do good and once they are committed to doing good (it becomes a habit to do good), internalization of values has taken place. This will enable them to acquire an internal moral compass which will help them to make morally upright and responsible decisions in the future.

### **KEY PROGRAMMES**

During the planning of VIA activities the students’ needs at the three learning phases are considered and ensures that the age appropriateness of the activities are adhered to. The school also hopes that the knowledge, skills and values learnt can be transferred back home so that doing the right thing becomes a habit for the students. This will contribute to them becoming active contributors and concerned citizens in the future.

The school works with various partners, for example Lions Befrienders Service Association and Sembcorp, to provide real life learning experiences where students are able to apply the values that they have learnt.
