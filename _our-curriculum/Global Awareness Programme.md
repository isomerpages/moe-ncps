### **Global Awareness Programme (GAP)**
#### **心系南侨，放眼世界**

Nan Chiau’s Global Awareness Programme (GAP) emphasizes collective identity and enhances global outlook among our students. Experiential Learning Theory is extensively applied. We strive to provide opportunities for our students to: 

1.	stay rooted to their heritage while setting their sights afar;
2.	develop global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. 
3.	establish network and build friendship across borders and cultures;
4.	deepen students’ rootedness to Singapore
