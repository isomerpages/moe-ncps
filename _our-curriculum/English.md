### **English Language Department**

The English Department is a diverse group of life-long learners who constantly challenge and encourage our students to learn actively, communicate effectively and think critically so that they contribute their acquired skills to the community.

### **VISION**  
Our students are active listeners, effective readers, inspiring speakers talented writers, and passionate learners of integrity.

### **MISSION**  
To instil the love of English Language Learning and Reading through different strategies and foster life-long learning by Integrating 21 CC and values into the curriculum.

**APPROACH TO EL TEACHING**  
At NCPS, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading, writing, speaking, listening, viewing & representing skills for effective communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience through explicit instruction and communicative approach to language development. The learning experience of the students are segmented into three phases: the exposure phase (P1&2), the experiential phase (P3&4) and the enhancement phase (P5&6) to match the progressive development of students Anchored on the English Language Syllabus 2010 (MOE, Singapore), we employ the following strategies in our EL classrooms:

### **STELLAR (MOE SINGAPORE)**  
Through Strategies for English Language Learning And Reading (STELLAR), we hope to instil in our students the love for reading because we believe that reading copiously will benefit all language skills.

**Lower Primary STELLAR**

At lower primary, the programmes are customised to focus more on values and one of the 21st Century Competencies: communication, collaboration and information skills. Lessons are designed such that students will display these attributes. They communicate information and ideas clearly and collaborate effectively. Where values are concerned, students will demonstrate that they are able to manage, create and share information thoughtfully, ethically and responsibly.

At middle primary, lessons are focused on experiential learning and one of the 21st Century Competencies: Critical and Inventive thinking skills. The programmes at this phase are customised to provide students with experiential learning that leverage on the use of 1:1 computing device.

### **Primary 3 i.m.Learning** <br>

At P3, the inquiry-based mobilised learning (i.m.learning) is a technology-aided, philosophy driven approach to enacting MOE’s STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning and Reading). Lessons are infused with an adapted version of Philosophy for Children (P4C) as well as an abridged version of Marzano’s 6-steps to Better Vocabulary Instruction to address the various language skills competency in our students.

At P 5 and 6, students’ learning is further enhanced. Flipped lessons are carried out termly to provide opportunity for students to practise higher-order reasoning and self-directed learning. Through customised programmes, students are engaged to actively contribute to the community and nation.

### **SCHOOL-BASED READING PROGRAMME** <br>

The objective of our Reading Programme is to develop students’ interest and positive attitude to learning beyond their comfort zones, indirectly improving their achievement in the language, and fostering in them a life-long habit of self-directed learning for information and enjoyment. By providing students with a repertoire of resources that are current and of interest, we believe that their motivation in learning beyond the classroom will grow. Students will be intrinsically motivated to find out more, share their knowledge, and build on one another’s knowledge.  

**Stage 1: Exposure**  
**\[1\] National Geographic Kids**  
It provides an additional reading resource as we extend students’ learning and expose them to the world around them.

**Stage 3 : Enhancement** <br>

Its wide coverage opens the students’ horizons and also facilitates the continuous discussion that our teachers conduct with our students in and beyond the classrooms.

### **HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT**  
Guided by the principles of Assessment OF Learning (AoL) and Assessment FOR Learning (AfL), we monitor students’ learning through a wide range of assessment modes, which are used to provide feedback to facilitate future learning (formative) and to ascertain students’ level of language competency at that point in time (summative). The various modes of assessment include:

1.  Performance-based Assessment such as show-and-tell and reading aloud and Mastery Tests for Lower Primary
2.  Mid-Year & Year-End Semestral Assessment (SA) – for middle primary
3.  CAs and SAs – for upper primary
4.  Primary 3 to 6 students go through a reflection process after Term 2 and Term 3 assessments.
