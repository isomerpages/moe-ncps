### **English Language Department**

The English Department is a diverse group of life-long learners who constantly challenge and encourage our students to learn actively, communicate effectively and think critically so that they contribute their acquired skills to the community.

### **Vision**  
Our students are active listeners, effective readers, inspiring speakers talented writers, and passionate learners of integrity.

### **Mission**  
To instil the love of English Language Learning and Reading through different strategies and foster life-long learning by Integrating 21 CC and values into the curriculum.

### **Our Approach**  
At NCPS, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading,
writing, speaking, listening, viewing & representing skills for effective
communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience
through explicit instruction and communicative approach to language
development anchored on the English Language Syllabus 2020 (MOE,
Singapore).

### **Core Curriculum**  
STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) is the core
curriculum which the school adopts for English Language. STELLAR aims to
strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a
positive attitude towards learning in the foundation years. The programme
uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to
engage children in the learning of English.

At middle primary, lessons are focused on experiential learning and one of the 21st Century Competencies: Critical and Inventive thinking skills. The programmes at this phase are customised to provide students with experiential learning that leverage on the use of 1:1 computing device.

### **Primary 3 i.m.Learning** <br>

At P3, the inquiry-based mobilised learning (i.m.learning) is a technology-aided, philosophy driven approach to enacting MOE’s STELLAR (STrategies for English Language Learning and Reading). Lessons are infused with an adapted version of Philosophy for Children (P4C) as well as an abridged version of Marzano’s 6-steps to Better Vocabulary Instruction to address the various language skills competency in our students.

At P 5 and 6, students’ learning is further enhanced. Flipped lessons are carried out termly to provide opportunity for students to practise higher-order reasoning and self-directed learning. Through customised programmes, students are engaged to actively contribute to the community and nation.

### **School-based Reading Programme** <br>

The objective of our Reading Programme is to develop students’ interest and positive attitude to learning beyond their comfort zones, indirectly improving their achievement in the language, and fostering in them a life-long habit of self-directed learning for information and enjoyment. By providing students with a repertoire of resources that are current and of interest, we believe that their motivation in learning beyond the classroom will grow. Students will be intrinsically motivated to find out more, share their knowledge, and build on one another’s knowledge.  

**Stage 1: Exposure**  
**\[1\] National Geographic Kids**  
It provides an additional reading resource as we extend students’ learning and expose them to the world around them.

**Stage 3 : Enhancement** <br>
**\[3\] ACE Magazine** <br>
It is a reading resource designed and written in an engaging manner that brings together news, current affairs, history, culture, technology, Science and media into a comprehensive reading supplement for our students. Its wide coverage opens the students’ horizons and also facilitates the continuous discussion that our teachers conduct with our students in and beyond the classrooms.

### **Holistic Assessment**  
Guided by the principles of Assessment OF Learning (AoL) and Assessment FOR Learning (AfL), we monitor students’ learning through a wide range of assessment modes, which are used to provide feedback to facilitate future learning (formative) and to ascertain students’ level of language competency at that point in time (summative). The various modes of assessment include:

1.  Performance-based Assessment such as show-and-tell and reading aloud and Mastery Tests for Lower Primary
2.  Mid-Year & Year-End Semestral Assessment (SA) – for middle primary
3.  CAs and SAs – for upper primary
4.  Primary 3 to 6 students go through a reflection process after Term 2 and Term 3 assessments.
