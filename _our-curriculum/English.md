### **English Language Department**

The English Department is a diverse group of life-long learners who constantly challenge and encourage our students to learn actively, communicate effectively and think critically so that they contribute their acquired skills to the community.

### **Vision** 

Our students are active listeners, effective readers, inspiring speakers, talented writers, and passionate life-long learners.

### **Mission**  

To instil the love of English Language Learning and Reading through different strategies and foster life-long learning by Integrating 21 CC and values into the curriculum.

### **Our Approach**  
   
At NCPS, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading, writing, speaking, listening, viewing & representing skills for effective communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience through explicit instruction and communicative approach to language development anchored on the English Language Syllabus 2020 (MOE, Singapore).

### **Core Curriculum**  
STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) is the core
curriculum which the school adopts for English Language. STELLAR aims to
strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a
positive attitude towards learning in the foundation years. The programme
uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to
engage children in the learning of English.

##### **School-based Reading Programme**

The objective of our Reading Programme is to develop students’ interest and positive attitude to
learning beyond their comfort zones, indirectly improving their achievement in the language, and
fostering in them a life-long habit of self-directed learning for information and enjoyment. By
providing students with a repertoire of resources that are current and of interest, we believe that
their motivation in learning beyond the classroom will grow. Students will be intrinsically motivated
to find out more, share their knowledge, and build on one another’s knowledge.

##### **What is learning support?**
   
Through specialised early intervention programmes, students are provided with structured curriculum to close their learning gaps with their peers.

The programmes are conducted by trained teachers who focused on building language skills in small groups of not more than ten students.

##### **iCT in the curriculum**

In Nan Chiau Primary School our self-directed learners:

* are intrinsically motivated to learn.
* take ownership of their own learning.
* manage and monitor their learning independently.
* explore and sustain their interests beyond the curriculum.

NCPS students are also connected learners who continually learn by:
* collaborating with their peers, the community and the world.
* connecting a range of online and offline information sources.

In addition , NCPS students are digital learners who leverage
technology for learning and can:
* find, think, apply and digitally create.
* navigate the digital space in a safe and responsible way.

### **Holistic Assessment**  
Guided by the principles of Assessment OF Learning (AoL) and Assessment FOR Learning (AfL), we monitor students’ learning through a wide range of assessment modes, which are used to provide feedback to facilitate future learning (formative) and to ascertain students’ level of language competency at that point in time (summative). The various modes of assessment include:

1.  Performance-based Assessment such as show-and-tell and reading aloud and Mastery Tests for Lower Primary
2.  Mid-Year & Year-End Semestral Assessment (SA) – for middle primary
3.  CAs and SAs – for upper primary
4.  Primary 3 to 6 students go through a reflection process after Term 2 and Term 3 assessments.
