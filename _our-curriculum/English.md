### **English Department**

The English Department is a diverse group of life-long learners who constantly challenge and encourage our students to learn actively, communicate effectively and think critically so that they contribute their acquired skills to the community.

Our students are active listeners, effective readers, inspiring speakers, talented writers, and passionate life-long learners.

### **Mission**  

To instil the love of English Language Learning and Reading through different strategies and foster life-long learning by Integrating 21 CC and values into the curriculum.

### **Our Approach**  
   
At NCPS, we aim to equip students with a strong foundation in reading, writing, speaking, listening, viewing & representing skills for effective communication and provide an enjoyable language learning experience through explicit instruction and communicative approach to language development anchored on the English Language Syllabus 2020 (MOE, Singapore).

### **Core Curriculum**  

STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) is the core
curriculum which the school adopts for English Language. STELLAR aims to
strengthen children’s language and reading skills as well as promote a
positive attitude towards learning in the foundation years. The programme
uses research-based teaching strategies and age-appropriate materials to
engage children in the learning of English.

##### **School-based Reading Programme**

The objective of our Reading Programme is to develop students’ interest and positive attitude to
learning beyond their comfort zones, indirectly improving their achievement in the language, and
fostering in them a life-long habit of self-directed learning for information and enjoyment. By
providing students with a repertoire of resources that are current and of interest, we believe that
their motivation in learning beyond the classroom will grow. Students will be intrinsically motivated
to find out more, share their knowledge, and build on one another’s knowledge.

##### **Experiential Learning**  
   
* Teaching English with hands-on activities can help language students learn and practice new vocabulary, grammar, ideas, and concepts.
* Students learn in a variety of ways, so it is important to teach using multiple methods. By incorporating hands-on experiences in our English lessons, students have higher levels of engagement and learning.
