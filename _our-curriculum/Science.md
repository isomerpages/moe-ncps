### **Department Vision**

Active Inquirers, Lifelong and Confident Learners

### **Department Mission**

•	Building a strong foundation in Science to allow students to possess scientific mindsets 
•	Providing a holistic education with a strong focus on demonstrating ways of thinking and doing in Science 
•	Instilling curiosity and providing students with experiences to inquire like scientists


### **Science Experiences And Programmes**

Guided by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Science Curriculum Framework, our Science curriculum aims to equip our students with the scientific literacy and disposition to inquire and understand themselves and the world around them. 
At Nan Chiau Primary School, we provide students with experiences which build on their interest in and stimulate their curiosity about the world around them. These learning experiences provide students with opportunities to develop skills, positive habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry. Learning of Science also takes place beyond the classrooms to enrich students’ experiences and make Science relevant to the real world around them.
Our Science programmes are designed to provide opportunities for our students to explore, investigate and discover scientific knowledge. We want our students to be curious and concerned about their surroundings. We seek to fuel this spirit of inquiry and hope that our students can appreciate how Science influences people and the environment.



##### **Inquiry-based Learning**
Science curriculum at NCPS adopts the pedagogy of Inquiry-based Learning using the BSCS (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) 5E Instructional model. Students are provided with opportunities to engage in meaningful learning of key scientific ideas as they are taken through the 5 key stages of learning in the 5E Instructional Model – Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate. Students carry out hands-on investigations and apply scientific knowledge using various process skills. Through active learning, students acquire the skills to synthesize knowledge, transfer their learning in varied contexts and make connections with their surroundings


##### **Use of Dataloggers and IT Resources**

At various levels, students are actively engaged in learning with the use dataloggers to conduct simple investigations. Harnessing the affordances in technology, lessons are designed to provide platforms for students to learn seamlessly - both in classroom and out-of-classroom, both within and after curriculum time. Students will embark on online learning using Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) as well as mobile learning using iPads. Through the use of devices and various online platforms, the learning of Science can be conducted both in-school and out-of-school.

##### **Young Scientist Badge Scheme**


##### **Young Scientist Badge Scheme**

Our NCPS Science teachers are always coming up with creative and innovative strategies to make learning fun and meaningful for our students. One of the strategies is to engage the pupils in simple hands-on activities. Students explore and experiment Science activities during their recess break, allowing the students to learn as they play.

### **Eco-garden**

Our garden provides green pockets of garden landscape in the school which serves both aesthetic and educational purposes. There are habitats for butterflies, plots of flowering plants, fruit trees, herbs, cacti and climbers, and a rotting log and leaf litter.  It is common that students get to spot some ‘visitors’ to our gardens like caterpillars, butterflies and birds. The garden also features an eco-pond complete with a huge clear glass tank and submerged water plants and a wooden viewing platform.

Our garden acts as the ‘outdoor’ classroom, for students to be engaged in exploring different species of plants and animals in their natural environment. This provides them an outdoor experiential learning opportunity to learn and know more about the different plants and animals around them.

### **Science Laboratories**

Our school currently has 2 Science laboratories – Einstein Room and Newton Room for students to experiment and participate in hands-on activities.

### **Learning Journeys**

In making Science concepts relevant, the students are brought outdoors to various places in Singapore to allow them the opportunity to see, feel, touch and hear the natural environment and understand the concepts behind what they observe in their surroundings.

### **P3@The Singapore Zoo**

As part of the P3 Seamless Learning programme, all the Primary 3 students visited the Singapore Zoo to learn more about the Animal Kingdom.  They were tasked to complete a few online activities which were accessed via the smart devices. Through this experiential learning, they were exposed to the different groups of animals and their characteristics and experienced authentic learning in a real zoo environment.
