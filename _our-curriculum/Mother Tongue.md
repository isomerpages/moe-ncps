### **Signature Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Programmes**

##### **Chinese Classics Exposure**
Nan Chiau has a tradition of promoting Chinese Classics Reading since we moved to Sengkang. Students learn “Guidelines to be a Good Person” or “Di Zi Gui”《弟子规》, The Three Character Classics《三字经》and The Analects《论语》．

In conjunction with NC75, Nan Chiau published a school-based Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) teaching package, incorporating the Chinese Classics. This initiative is for all students and aims to compliment the refreshed Character and Citizenship Education curriculum.
