### **Watch Me Soar**
Supporting our school’s vision, “An Innovative School where Inspiring Educators Nurture Future-Ready Leaders” and Singapore’s Smart Nation vision of becoming a nation where people live meaningful and fulfilled lives, enabled seamlessly by technology, offering opportunities for all, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is focusing on the theme of “Health Science” as it provides opportunities for students to contribute toward society with inventions to improve the health and daily living of people. 
The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Nan Chiau Primary School (NCPS) focuses on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in areas of Health Science. Students from Primary 3 to 5 are introduced to Design Thinking, Computational Thinking and Maker Education in our ALP curriculum. Our ALP is known as Watch Me Soar (WMS) programme with the following objectives:

### **Collaboration with Sengkang General Hospital (SKH)**
This year, NCPS collaborated with Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) to bring authentic learning experiences to our students.  The collaboration involves SKH personnel and Primary 5 students from NCPS, in coming up with solutions to address authentic real-life situations related to the theme of Health Science.  This collaboration provided our students with opportunities for exploration, collaboration and creativity, empowering them to innovate to serve the community. 

This year, staff from SKH provided four different problem statements for our Primary 5 students to solve during the school-based curriculum, Watch Me Soar (WMS) lessons.

Zoom sessions with SKH personnel were conducted for the students to gather more information on the four problem statements. The students had the chance to interview nurses and speech therapists from SKH during their WMS lessons.

From the zoom sessions, interviews with own family members and researchers, our students worked in groups to come out with creative prototypes to solve the above problem statements. The students learn as they work on their prototype creations with feedback given by their teachers and SKGH personnel.
